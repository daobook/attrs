"On the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, "
"`dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/)"
" of *attrs*). In practice it does a lot more and is more flexible. For "
"instance it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for "
"equality "
"checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), "
"or allows more ways to [plug into the initialization "
"process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-"

"*attrs* is for creating well-behaved classes with a type, attributes, "
"methods, and everything that comes with a class. It can be used for data-"
"only containers like `namedtuple`s or `types.SimpleNamespace` but they're"
" just a sub-genre of what *attrs* is good for."

msgid "**The class belongs to the users.**"

msgid ""
"You define a class and *attrs* adds static methods to that class based on"
" the attributes you declare. The end. It doesn't add metaclasses. It "
"doesn't add classes you've never heard of to your inheritance tree. An "
"*attrs* class in runtime is indistinguishable from a regular class: "
"because it *is* a regular class with a few boilerplate-y methods "
"attached."

#: ../../overview.md:30
msgid ""
"As convenient as it seems at first, *attrs* will *not* tack on any "
"methods to your classes except for the {term}`dunder ones <dunder "
"methods>`. Hence all the useful [tools](helpers) that come with *attrs* "
"live in functions that operate on top of instances. Since they take an "
"*attrs* instance as their first argument, you can attach them to your "
"classes with one line of code."

"*attrs* runtime impact is very close to zero because all the work is done"
" when the class is defined. Once you're instantiating it, *attrs* is out "
"of the picture completely."

"*attrs* creates classes that arguably work the way a Python beginner "
"would reasonably expect them to work. It doesn't try to guess what you "
"mean because explicit is better than implicit. It doesn't try to be "
"clever because software shouldn't be clever."

"*attrs* does *not* invent some kind of magic system that pulls classes "

"interdependencies."

"It does *nothing* dynamic at runtime, hence zero runtime overhead. It's "
